# Feedback: CTA exercise 5 (2024)

# question 1
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# good work

# question 2
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# very good. Very well commented code. 
# you should spend more time and writing space on explanation of decision-making (eg number of topics)
# and on interpretation (e.g. you didn't explain the consistency analysis)

# question 3
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# the code is good but you didn't interpret the output
# would have been worth checking out the PreText documentation to figure out how to read the output
# and what to do with it

# overall code quality: 
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# very good, good commenting etc

# overall interpretation: 
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# you need to invest more still in writing out interpretation of results. Any plot/output should be accompanied by written
# text that reports the key results and interpret them for the research question.
