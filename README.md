# CTA-ED-exercise5

In this repository you will find the material for exercise 5 (to be completed for the 13th of March 2024). This is part of the course 'Computational Text Analysis' taught at the University of Edinburgh by Dr. Marion Lieutaud. There is no datafile in this repository as the code in the Rmd script will show you how to download it directly.

# Starting instructions

This is an ASSESSED GROUP exercise. If you attended the class on 6/03, you formed groups and identified one group member as a group lead. The group lead is in charge of forking the repository and adding the other group members as collaborators. Group members can then clone the forked repository (using Github Desktop as we did last week) so you can work on the R code on your own laptop. 

You may want to distribute the exercise questions between group members. This will help avoid the headache of code clashes, which can happen if several group members are trying to work on the same question and code chunks at the same time. You will also want to regularly 'pull' commits (again, using Github desktop) from the online forked repository: this basically means that you are regularly updating the repository you're working on. It's important to do that regularly or you might not realise that other group members have already edited content you're working on. Once you're happy with your code on R, save your edits, then go to Github Desktop, click 'commit to main' and then 'push origin'. This will push your commits onto the online forked repository that your collaborators have access to. Don't forget to click on 'push origin' or it won't work.

The exercise questions are at the end of the .Rmd file. All group members can work directly on the same .Rmd document, or you can initially create multiple documents (e.g. exercise2_Alex.Rmd; exercise2_Jess.Rmd) and combine your code into one final document before next class. The final output should be a single document, knitted into a single html (click on 'knit' within R and let the magic happen). So if you initially split the work into different documents, you will need to leave a little time at the end to assemble the different documents into a single one and make sure it knits smoothly to html.

The exercise questions are at the end of the .Rmd file. Make sure you fill out the names of all group members in the header of the final Rmarkdown document.

To do this exercise, you should draw on the code presented in the exercise, the demos, previous exercises (the answers for exercise 2 are in the exercise 2 repo) and the livecoding scripts that we have developed in the tutorials (these are available on Learn, in the tutorial material section for each week). You can also look for help and inspiration in other online resources, including for example the quanteda tutorial page [https://quanteda.io], the quanteda quick start guide [https://quanteda.io/articles/quickstart], and Stack Overflow [https://stackoverflow.com]. You may find Regex Cheatsheets (e.g. [https://hypebright.nl/index.php/en/2020/05/25/ultimate-cheatsheet-for-regex-in-r-2/] and the Stringr package cheatsheet (for string detection) [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/strings.pdf] particularly useful.

Make sure to comment your code as you go, ideally line-by-line, at the very least chunk by chunk. This will help you remember why you wrote your code the way you did, what the code was meant to do, and it will help you explain your code to the class - which you may be asked to do.

On top of writing the code, you need to *write out the interpretation of the analyses you ran%. At a minimum, this means a couple of lines per question.

This is a formative assignment. It will be assessed by the lecturer.
